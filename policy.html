<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Cherrygram is a communication app based on Telegram api. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account. We do not collect, store, or use any of this information.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Cherrygram is a cloud service based on Telegram api. Telegram store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <i>cloud chats</i> on Telegram servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted on Telegram servers. We do not collect, store, or use any of this information, and we do not know who or when you messaged via cloud chats.</span></p>
<h5 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.6px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>3.2. Secret Chats</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Secret chats</i> use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is <b>no way</b> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We do not collect, store, or use any of this information. and we do not know who or when you messaged via secret chats.</span></p>
<h5 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.6px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>3.3. Media in Secret Chats</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded to Telegram servers, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. Your recipient can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space. We do not collect, store, or use any of this information.</span></p>
<h5 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.6px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>3.4. Public Chats</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to private messages, Cherrygram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats. Like everything on Cherrygram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone. We do not collect, store, or use any of this information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>4. Phone Number and Contacts</b></span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Cherrygram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Telegram store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Cherrygram and to properly display names in notifications. We do not store any of this data about you or your contacts</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them fromTelegram's servers in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Data Settings.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you share your Live Location in any chat or turn on <i>’Make Myself Visible’</i> in People Nearby, Cherrygram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the App is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated.</span></p>
